We are building a simple exhibition App with next.js in the frontend and supabase in the backend. 
Keep it simple but elegant. It should look good on iPad and mobile, make sure to optimize for it. 
Use shadcn ui components. The frontend is only reading from the supabase db. It is not writing to it.

in server rendered components you need to await props.params; because otherwise it raises  `params` should be awaited before using its properties. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis error
